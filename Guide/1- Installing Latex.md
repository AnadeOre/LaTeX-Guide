If you are still not sure of weather you'll like LaTeX or not, it might be a good idea to skip this step and instead use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

1. Download and install the TeX/LaTeX distribution from [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download) for your operating system.

**At a certain point when installing MiKTeX it will give us an options about how to install packages, we recommend you choosing the option "On the fly".**

2. Choose a LaTeX Editor

We have quite a few options here, I will give you some of my personal recommendations:

**TeXStudio**: You can dowload it [here](https://www.texstudio.org/). TeXStudio's objective is to make LaTeX writing as easy and comfortable as possible. That's why it has numerous characteristics such as an integrated visor, syntaxis results and bibliography assistance among many others.
